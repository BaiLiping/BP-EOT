- Object-oriented design with separate classes for data generation and filtering
- Test scripts and examples
- See the [Python README](Python_Implementation/README.md) for detailed documentation

### `/arXiv-2103.11279v4`
Paper source files (LaTeX) and figures.

## Overview

The Extended Object Tracking algorithm enables:
- Detection and tracking of multiple extended objects with unknown shapes
- Handling of measurement uncertainty and clutter
- Belief propagation-based data association
- Particle filtering for non-linear dynamics
- Inverse Wishart modeling of object extents

## Getting Started

### MATLAB Implementation
1. Navigate to the `/Meyer` directory
2. Run `main.m` in MATLAB
3. The script will generate a scenario with 5 extended objects and track them over 50 time steps

### Python Implementation
1. Navigate to the `/Python_Implementation` directory
2. Install required packages: `pip install numpy scipy matplotlib`
3. Run example scripts:
   - `python test_main_replication.py` - Replicates the MATLAB main.m behavior
   - `python example_usage.py` - Simple usage example
   - `python test_fixed_filter.py` - Test with improved filter implementation

## Key Features

- **Scalable tracking**: Handles multiple closely-spaced extended objects
- **Shape estimation**: Jointly estimates object positions and elliptical shapes
- **Belief propagation**: Efficient probabilistic data association
- **No clustering required**: Avoids traditional measurement clustering approaches
- **Particle-based**: Supports non-linear dynamics and non-Gaussian distributions
